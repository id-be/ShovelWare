path2d points are set to the array of points generated after user clicks and holds mouse down.

if user releases, path drawing auto-stops and set and dragon follows path.
timer goes off as soon as user presses mouse.
if user releases, timer auto-stops.
once timer goes off, dragon follow path is set on points collected every __ (step) seconds of timer. 
ballistas pre-fixed and facing one way. if dragon passes there, it gets hit with bolt and falls to death. might need to make animation for it.


if final point.x isn't castle's x, add penultimate point that is castle's coordinate, then add the final off grid point (see below).

final point in path should be hard coded to half screen height, 1.5 * screen width (0.5 * height, 1.5 * width) to take dragon off screen.

nice-to-have: make dragoncursor sprite rotate according to the previous point's look_at rotation to its current position? or to the next generated point. something like that.
